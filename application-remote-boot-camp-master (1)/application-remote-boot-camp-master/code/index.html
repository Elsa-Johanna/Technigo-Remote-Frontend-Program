        <h2>What is SASS?</h2>

            <h3>SASS is short for</h3>
            <p>Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets</p>
          
            <h3>Extention for CSS</h3>
            <p>SASS is an extension to help you with your CSS. 
              It acts like a preprocessor for CSS meaning it can implement features
              that does not exist in a normal CSS.
              Developers can write code in one language ans SASS helps you compile it into CSS
              SASS also helps you nest your CSS code, much like HTML’s nesting </p>
     
            <h3>Helps you with lager projects</h3>
            <p>For example, you can split up the SASS files into modules.
              This helps keeping a good overlook of your code when you are coding lager projects.
            </p>
